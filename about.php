	<h1>About Swapp.com</h1>
	<h3>What is Swapp.com?</h3>
	<p>Swapp.com is a FREE website created by a student to help other students save the most money on school books. Swapp.com is a tool that allows students to connect with other students to buy and sell their school textbooks. </p>
	<h3>How can this help me save money on my textbooks?</h3>
	<p>Third-party companies and bookstores raise the prices of school textbooks by buying from students at a low price and then turning around and selling the used textbooks to other students at a higher price for profit. With Swapp.com you can save money by skipping the middleman companies and buying and selling directly student to student. </p>
	<p>With this method you can save the most money by buying used textbooks then selling them to other students for a reasonable price. If done right, you will spend a lot less money than you would by using the other means like renting a textbook, buying an eBook, or buying from a local or campus bookstore.</p>
	<h3>What is unique about Swapp.com? </h3>
	<p>Unlike other classified websites, you can filter your search results to buy your textbooks from other students at your school, who already took the same class that you just enrolled in. It makes it easier than ever to sell your school textbooks and allows you to save the most money when buying your next textbook. This means that you will finally be able to sell those professors written class specific textbooks!</p>
