# Website-1
This is a website that I started making during the summer of 2017. I didn't finish it because I found another company that recently made the website which I was planning on making and they had a big competitive advantage so I moved on to other projects. My idea for this website was to create a classifieds page where college students could sell their textbooks to other students at their same school whom would be taking the same class in as them in the following semester. This way students wouldn't have to go through campus book stores or other 3rd party companies to resell their textbooks. I learned alot from creating this website. I learned about php and linking in different webpages to make it easier to update the website. I learned about using regex patterns and validating forums. I learned how to put a server on my computer to run the website which I linked to a MySQL database and I started getting into hashing passwords and using salts for encryption. I could make an account to log in but I never finished actually being able to log into the system and start a session.
